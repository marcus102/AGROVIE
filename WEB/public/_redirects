# Netlify redirects file for React SPA with client-side routing

# Handle all routes and serve index.html for client-side routing
# This ensures that direct navigation to any route works properly
/*    /index.html   200

# Optional: If you have API endpoints that should return 404
# Uncomment the line below if you have actual API routes that should not fallback to index.html
# /api/*  /api/:splat  404

# Optional: Redirect old URLs (add as needed)
# /old-path  /new-path  301

# The /* rule above must be the last rule to catch all unmatched routes
